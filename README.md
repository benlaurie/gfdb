GridFinity Divider Boxes in Fusion 360

NOTE: This is no longer maintained, but has been copied to a new repo for my f360 utils, https://github.com/jamiesmith/fusion360scripts

## Bugs

- There are a few fillets missing.
- There should be a dialog asking what you want to make.
- No holes for screws.

None of these should be hard to fix - PRs welcome!
